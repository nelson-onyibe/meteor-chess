      Pieces can be moved by first clicking on the piece that shall be moved
      and then clicking on the field where the piece should move.
      If the move is legal according to the chess rules, the piece will be moved
      and the other player is to move. Fields that are selected for the move are
      highlighted in green.<br />
      If you accidentally selected the wrong piece to move, just click that piece
      again and the selection will be reset, so that another piece can be moved.
      Here the game deliberately departs from the rule provided by the FIDE
      (i.e. the World Chess Federation), which states that a piece that has been
      touched by the player has to be moved. The reason is that on some devices
      like tablets it may sometimes be a bit hard to click/touch the correct
      field.
