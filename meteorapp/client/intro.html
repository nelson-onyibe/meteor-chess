      Welcome to Meteor Chess!
      <br /><br />
      This web application allows you to play
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess" target="_blank">chess</a>
      with another player. Pieces are moved by first clicking on the piece that
      shall be moved and then clicking on the field where the piece should move.
      If the move is legal according to the chess rule, the piece will be moved
      and the other player is to move. Fields that are selected for the move are
      highlighted in green.<br />
      If you accidentally selected the wrong piece to move, just click that piece
      again and the selection will be reset, so that another piece can be moved.
      Here the game deliberately departs from the rule provided by the FIDE
      (i.e. the World Chess Federation), which states that a piece that has been
      touched by the player has to be moved. The reason is that on some devices
      like tablets it may sometimes be a bit hard to click/touch the correct
      field.
      <br /><br />
      Apart from that the normal chess rules apply.<br />
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling" target="_blank">Castling</a>
      is initiated by moving the king two fields into the direction of the tower
      that shall be part of the castling move. For example, moving the white king
      from e1 to g1 initiates kingside castling, and moving the white king from
      e1 to c1 initiates queenside castling. The corresponding moves apply for
      the black king.
      <br /><br />
      That's all for the introduction, have fun.
